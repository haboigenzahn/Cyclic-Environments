# Cyclic-Environments
Repository for code and data associated with "Enhancement of prebiotic peptide formation in cyclic environments" by Hayley Boigenzahn, Praful Gagrani, and John Yin. 

TwoMechanism_Replenishment_KineticModel.py is the main code used to generate figures and results for this paper. 
Experimental results plotted by this code are located in the Data folder.

Parameter estimation data contains the experimental data used to estimate the parameters of Mechanism 1 and Mechanism 2, along with code from 
https://github.com/haboigenzahn/OoL-KineticParameterEstimation which was used to perform the parameter fitting
The parameter results from fitting can be found in the Supplemental Information of the paper.
